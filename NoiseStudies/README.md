Noise studies
====

Use the local run to extract the pedestals.
Once the pedestals are defined (by Jean) and also the RMS of the pedestals is set (by Jean),
that is actually used as input by the local reconstruction, run local reconstruction (multifit)
and check the noise spectrum in reconstructed amplitude.

Run reconstruction step:
